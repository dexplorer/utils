Depending on your exact situation, there are three useful ways to use git diff:

Show differences between index and working tree; that is, changes you haven't staged to commit:
git diff [filename]
Show differences between current commit and index; that is, what you're about to commit (--staged does exactly the same thing, use what you like):
git diff --cached [filename]
git diff --staged
Show differences between current commit and working tree:
git diff HEAD [filename]
git diff works recursively on directories, and if no paths are given, it shows all changes.
